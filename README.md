# bock üç∫

A small personal Markdown and `git`-powered wiki I wrote to teach myself Go. [You can see it in action here](https://wiki.nikhil.io/).

## Usage

See [the releases page](https://github.com/afreeorange/bock/releases) for a few pre-built binaries.

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/afreeorange/bockgo.git

# Now point it at a git repository full of Markdown files
# and tell it where to generate the output
go run --tags "fts5" . -a /path/to/repo -o /path/to/output -r -j
```

## Terminology and Setup

An "**Entity**" is either 

- An "**Article**", a Markdown file ending in `.md` somewhere in your article repository, or 
- A "**Folder**, which is exactly what you think it is. You can organize your articles into folders at any depth.

A "**Revision**" is a `git` commit that modifies an Article.

Other stuff:

- The name of the Markdown file is the _title_ of the article and will map to its URI with underscores. For example,
  - `/Notes on Deleuze.md` will map to `/Notes_on_Deleuze`
  - `/Tech Stuff/OpenBSD/pf Notes.md` will map to `/Tech_Stuff/OpenBSD/pf_Notes`
- The root of the generated wiki will always redirect to `/Home` (for now) so you will need a `Home.md`.
  - You'll be warned if you don't have one.
- The paths `raw`, `revisions`, `random`, and `archive` are reserved. So, for example, don't create a `raw.md` anywhere. It will be overwritten.
- You can place static assets in `__assets` in your article repository. You can reference all assets in there in your Markdown files prefixed with `/assets` (e.g. `__assets/some-file.jpg` &rarr; `/assets/some-file.jpg`).
- Any dotfiles or dotfolders are ignored when generating the entity-tree. 
  - This includes `node_modules`. See [this file](https://github.com/afreeorange/bock/blob/master/constants.go) for other things. It's a small list. 

That's really about it.

The command in the "Usage" section will generate the following (using [this article](https://wiki.nikhil.io/CNN-IBNs_List_of_the_100_Greatest_Indian_Films_of_All_Time) as an example):

* Every Markdown article in your repository rendered as [HTML](https://wiki.nikhil.io/CNN-IBNs_List_of_the_100_Greatest_Indian_Films_of_All_Time/), [Raw Markdown](https://wiki.nikhil.io/CNN-IBNs_List_of_the_100_Greatest_Indian_Films_of_All_Time/raw/), and [JSON](https://wiki.nikhil.io/CNN-IBNs_List_of_the_100_Greatest_Indian_Films_of_All_Time/index.json)
* A [listing of all revisions](https://wiki.nikhil.io/CNN-IBNs_List_of_the_100_Greatest_Indian_Films_of_All_Time/revisions) for each article, if applicable. Some articles can be untracked and they will be annotated as such.
* Each article's revision rendered as [HTML](https://wiki.nikhil.io/CNN-IBNs_List_of_the_100_Greatest_Indian_Films_of_All_Time/revisions/04c7d651/) and [Raw Markdown](https://wiki.nikhil.io/CNN-IBNs_List_of_the_100_Greatest_Indian_Films_of_All_Time/revisions/04c7d651/raw)
* Each folder's structure in [HTML](https://wiki.nikhil.io/Food/) and [JSON](https://wiki.nikhil.io/Food/index.json)
* [An archive page](https://wiki.nikhil.io/archive/) that lets you search your articles thanks to SQLite and [SQL.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/)
* A Homepage (if it doesn't exist as `Home.md`) at [`/Home`](https://wiki.nikhil.io/Home/)
* A page that redirects to some random article at [`/random`](https://wiki.nikhil.io/random/)
* An index page that redirects to `/Home`
* A 404 Page at [`/404.html`](https://wiki.nikhil.io/404.html)

A giant work in progress but works pretty well for me so far. Uses a baby implementation of Go's [WaitGroups](https://gobyexample.com/waitgroups) so will be slow on older machines or those with less memory.

## Upcoming Features

- [ ] Categories/Tags
- [ ] Frontmatter support
- [ ] Live-watcher of articles
