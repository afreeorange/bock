# Bock UI

A simple UI for [Bock](https://github.com/afreeorange/bock).

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start a live-reloading server
yarn start

# Run tests
yarn test
```

### TODO

* [ ] Some state management; esp for `isFolder` and the like you know? `Nav` has no way to know that it's on a folder route right now.
* [ ] Progress bar
* [ ] Page transitions
* [ ] Search for article titles!
* [ ] Accessibility :/
* [ ] Don't re-render/call upstream for Raw :/
